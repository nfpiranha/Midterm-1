	<p><strong>This site is meant to be a community driven forum geared towards reaching a 
	grater collective understanding of art. We understand that there are many different
	viewpoints and interpretations from everybody, and this acts as a place where all 
	of them can be explored and fleshed out. By default you will see the most popular and discussed pieces, 
	and there are also options for sub-categories, similar to a hashtag system in that it relies on key words
	to distinguish and collect pieces that fall under them. We also have a random button in case you with to just experience
	something new. In the future we hope to branch our from just paintings and into performances and sculptures as well.
	Art can be confusing, we get it, and we hope that this community driven base helps aid in understanding 
	such a key component of th ehuman spirit.</strong></p>
